This spring we had a wonderful time presenting our workshop at the Digital Initiatives Symposium and the Joint Conference on Digital Libraries. With over 30 attendees in total, we were able to hear from other people taking on the daunting task of digital repository selection and migration.   

Almost all of our attendees were thinking about migrating away from 3 specific platforms:

	- Bepress 
	- CONTENTdm
	- Islandora 

Luckily, because our Workshop [“Strategies and Tools for Digital Repository Selection and Migration”](/workshop/) is platform agnostic, participants left the workshop with a better understanding of the questions they would need to ask of their institutions and the contextualization they would need to have of their current digital repositories during their selection and migration process no matter which platform they were currently using. 


For those of you who were unable to attend and would like to take our workshop, please reach out to us and see how we can accommodate your situation.  We are happy to walk you through our best practices and toolkit, answer any questions you may have from looking over our slidedeck, or even do a virtual workshop if demand necessitates it. 


Here is just some of the feedback we received from attendees: 


“It was extremely helpful to think through our migration plans & how  to breakdown that process.”


“You seemingly cover every base. Can't say I imagined you would cover so much!”


“informative. enjoyed resources and insight to migration as a large-scale project”
