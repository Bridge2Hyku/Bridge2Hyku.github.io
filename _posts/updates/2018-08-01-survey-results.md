The report available below has the survey results from the four partner institutions as well as analysis of what this means for the broader community and it's migration needs. 

### [Bridge2Hyku Digital Collections Survey Report] (https://uh-ir.tdl.org/uh-ir/handle/10657/3307)

The Bridge2Hyku team is using the implications below as we navigate Phase 2 of the project. 

Implications for Migration Tools
* The migration tool(s) need to accommodate images, text and audio/visual materials in numerous access file types.
* The migration tool(s) should accommodate single, hierarchical, and multipart data model structures.
* The migration tool(s) should be flexible enough to accommodate multiple metadata schema and standards.
* The migration tool(s) should reconcile numerous controlled vocabularies including emerging vocabulary such as GeoNames.
* The migration tool(s) should account for various system dependencies for digital collections
* The migration tool(s) should allow for file renaming in transit.


Implications for Migration Strategy
* To achieve efficiency in migration, the B2H Toolkit should include documentation on migration planning including content and metadata analysis, mapping of metadata elements and values, metadata standardization and digital preservation considerations.
* The B2H Toolkit should include documentation on the migration workflow including metadata cleanup and remediation, materials reprocessing (rescanning and rerunning OCR), and step-by-step migration instructions.
* It will be beneficial to include a bibliography of best practices for digital collections migration in the B2H Toolkit.
