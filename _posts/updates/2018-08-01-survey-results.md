In February 2018, members of the [B2H Implementation Team](https://bridge2hyku.github.io/partners/) completed a survey to collect data related to their digital collections. This included information about metadata schema, production workflows, stakeholder considerations, and work/file types. This [report](https://uh-ir.tdl.org/uh-ir/handle/10657/3307) outlines the survey results and implications for digital collections migration planning and implementation (also shared below).

### [Â» Bridge2Hyku Digital Collections Survey Report](https://uh-ir.tdl.org/uh-ir/handle/10657/3307)


The main takeaway of the report, the implications below, are now helping the project team navigate Phase 2 of the project.  

__Implications for Migration Tools__
* The migration tool(s) need to accommodate images, text and audio/visual materials in numerous access file types.
* The migration tool(s) should accommodate single, hierarchical, and multipart data model structures.
* The migration tool(s) should be flexible enough to accommodate multiple metadata schema and standards.
* The migration tool(s) should reconcile numerous controlled vocabularies including emerging vocabulary such as GeoNames.
* The migration tool(s) should account for various system dependencies for digital collections
* The migration tool(s) should allow for file renaming in transit.


__Implications for Migration Strategy__
* To achieve efficiency in migration, the B2H Toolkit should include documentation on migration planning including content and metadata analysis, mapping of metadata elements and values, metadata standardization and digital preservation considerations.
* The B2H Toolkit should include documentation on the migration workflow including metadata cleanup and remediation, materials reprocessing (rescanning and rerunning OCR), and step-by-step migration instructions.
* It will be beneficial to include a bibliography of best practices for digital collections migration in the B2H Toolkit.
