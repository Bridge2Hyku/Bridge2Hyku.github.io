University of Miami Libraries’ migration has been put on hold but that doesn’t mean Elliot Williams, Digital Initiatives Metadata Librarian, couldn’t answer a few questions about how they view the current digital repository landscape and why migration can take so long to get started.  


**Original Platform?** CONTENTdm (locally-hosted)
 
 
**New Platform?** Still evaluating options
 
 
**If your migration is not going, please elaborate on the reasons it hasn’t moved forward** Leadership transitions and other priorities within the library have delayed this migration, but it is planned for the next year.
 
 
**What have been the biggest obstacles?** The limited number of repository platform options available, and the trade-offs involved with each, has been the biggest challenge as we try to determine what to migrate to.
 
 
**What’s gone well?** Thinking through the migration and our needs has given us a great opportunity to re-evaluate our practices and workflows, which we will continue to do as we move forward.
 
 
**What feature are you most excited about having?** We are excited about having a platform with a more modern and responsive look-and-feel for users, as well as one that supports IIIF.
 
 
**What advice would you share with those currently considering or beginning a migration?** No repository platform is perfect, and it is important to take into consideration how the platform will work for your institution, collections, and users.
