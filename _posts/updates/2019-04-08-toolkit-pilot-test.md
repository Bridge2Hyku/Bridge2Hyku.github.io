To wrap up phase two, the B2H project team at UH and UVic partnered with the Texas Digital Library (TDL) to conduct the B2H Toolkit Pilot Test. TDL is a consortium that provides open source digital repositories to higher education institutions in Texas. Hyku was developed as a Hyrax/Samvera instance with consortial use in mind. Planning began in the late summer of 2019. The pilot test occurred between November 2018 and February 2019. Participants tested against a rubric to provide structured feedback on functionality, pain points, and any missing features
