## Finishing up Phase 1

While tying up the loose ends on Bridge2Hyku's Phase 1, we created and presented two posters for TCDL's Minute Madness session. Todd Crocken presented "You Are Not Alone", while Anne Washington presented "Lessons from Bridge2Hyku Phase 1".  

### <a href="http://hdl.handle.net/10657/3058">You Are Not Alone: Statistics from Bridge2Hyku’s digital collections environment data collection survey</a>
This poster includes 6 graphs and 3 data-points from our forthcoming Digital Collections Survey Report. <br><br>
Abstract: As part of the deliverables for phase one of the Bridge2Hyku [B2H] project, funded by the Institute of Museum and Library Services (LG-70-17-0217-17), the project team at the University of Houston surveyed grant partner institutions about their digital collections. The survey was designed to collect data related to, but not limited to: content types, metadata schema, digital collection production workflows, preservation considerations, stakeholder considerations, and more. The poster will showcase statistics gleaned from the survey that highlight trends in the overall preparedness, or unpreparedness, of institutions transitioning their data in the digital space, particularly onto open source platforms.

A brief overview of Phase 1 and what will be occurring in Phase 2.<br><br>
Abstract: The Bridge2Hyku [B2H] project, funded by a grant from the Institute of Museum and Library Services (LG-70-17-0217-17) [1], will provide the digital archives community with a toolkit for content migration to the open source platform Hyku.. The B2H Toolkit plan and outcomes aim to establish a framework for sustainable data migration. The project will leverage IMLS’ investment to build capacity for libraries and cultural heritage institutions in adoption of Hyku nationally and worldwide. It will engage and strengthen the open source Samvera Community (formerly Hydra Community) around Hyku by leveraging our collective expertise through strategic collaboration between UH, IUB, IUPUI, UVic, UM, Stanford, DuraSpace, and DPLA.
<br><br>
As part of Phase 1 of the Bridge2Hyku project, the project team at University of Houston will be creating reports on the digital collection environments at various institutions and on the requirements and limitations of the Hyku platform.  Both of these reports will guide toolkit development in later phases of this project.  These reports will be made available on the Bridge2Hyku website, that will become a community center of sorts for any institutions that need guidance on content migrations in the future.  This poster presentation will highlight reports and will also provide information about future directions for B2H as well as information for institutions who are interested in getting involved in the B2H community.
