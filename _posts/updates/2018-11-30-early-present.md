Happy Holidays from the Bridge2Hyku Team! We’re excited to announce that our CONTENTdm exporting tool, CDM Bridge, is now available as a 1.0 release candidate!  This mean’s we’re ready for public beta testers and feel pretty confident in it's stability.

If you’ve ever wanted to look at your collections metadata at a glance, or have collections that are too big to export via CONTENTdm’s internal exporting functionality, CDM Bridge is a desktop application that can help.  

It is available to [DOWNLOAD HERE](http://bit.ly/cdm-bridge) and we’ve recently added a [GETTING STARTED](https://github.com/Bridge2Hyku/cdm-bridge/wiki) piece on the wiki.

If you have any questions, requests, or plaudites. Reach out to us!  @Bridge2Hyku on twitter.
