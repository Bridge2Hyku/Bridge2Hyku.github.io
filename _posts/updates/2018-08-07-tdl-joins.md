The Texas Digital Library (TDL) will join the [Bridge2Hyku Implementation Team](/partners/) in September to provide hosting services for a pilot test of the [B2H software toolkit](/toolkit/). TDL's hosting expertise will help the Bridge2Hyku team test its migration workflows and resolve any problems with migrating CONTENTdm data to hosted Hyku.  Hyku was built with a consortial hosting experience in mind, and it is critical to the project’s success to test that migration workflow. More from Courtney C. Mumma, Deputy Director of TDL: 

> As active participants in the Samvera Community’s newly formed Hyku Interest Group, we know that migration pathways to Hyku from systems like CONTENTdm are essential to Hyku adoption and service provision. The TDL is proud to be a part of this project on behalf of our members.

Members of the Bridge2Hyku team at the University of Houston also participated in TDL's Hyku pilot program in the spring of 2018, along with representatives from the University of Texas at Austin and Trinity University.  TDL has released their report about the pilot, and it is available at the following link:

__» [TDL 2018 Hyku Pilot Report](http://hdl.handle.net/2249.1/87490)__

The report details the impressions of the Hyku pilot testers and discusses the feasibility of using Hyku as a consortial platform.
