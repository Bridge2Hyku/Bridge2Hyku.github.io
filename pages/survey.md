## Bridge2Hyku Digital Collections Survey

Are you looking to migrate your digital collections? We would love to hear from you.  Our Migration Survey is a comprehensive list of questions regarding your institution's library characteristics, metadata, workflows, current digital collections, and current repositories.

No answers are required, so fill out what you can. Every response gets us closer to the actual needs of the community regarding repository migrations.
