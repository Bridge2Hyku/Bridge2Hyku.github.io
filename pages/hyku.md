## National Digital Platform {#national-digital-platform}

Hyku, the repository software produced by the Hydra-In-a-Box project, was built as a part of the Institute for Museum and Library Services' <a href="https://www.imls.gov/issues/national-issues/national-digital-platform">National Digital Platform</a> initiatve. It strives to be <a href="http://hydrainabox.samvera.org/">"a feature-rich, robust, flexible digital repository that is easy to install, configure, and maintain."</a>

## Hyku vs Hyrax vs Omeka {#product-comparison}

Hyku is an "out of the box" version of the Samvera community's Hyrax repository platform. If you do not have any web developers on staff or already plan to use a consortium to help offload technical issues, Hyku might be the right fit for you. Check out <a href="https://wiki.duraspace.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=85530575">this article</a> on Hyku's wiki. If you have developers on staff and are looking to have customized workflows and tech specs, consider using <a href="http://hyr.ax/">Hyrax</a> and joining the <a href="http://samvera.org/">Samvera community</a>. If you're looking to build an online exhibition or digital humanities project, <a href="https://omeka.org/news/2010/09/21/omeka-and-peers/">Omeka is a wonderful tool</a>. If you're looking to build a robust institutional repository or digital collections system, you might be better served by the Fedora/Solr/Blacklight-backed Hyku.

## Institutional Repository {institutional-repository}

Hyku is a good fit for institutional repository use cases, with out of the box support for self-deposit workflows and robust access controls.

## Cultural Heritage Repository {#cultural-heritage}

The Hyku development community is still working on adding functionality for cultural heritage use cases. The Hyku Pilot that occured in 2017 included a <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mpYLs2pqwKDCCxF0Kb-JTC4OjPLgmbJ6d1IBunxHqAw/edit?usp=sharing">gap assessment document</a> that should help determine whether or not Hyku is a good fit for your institution.
