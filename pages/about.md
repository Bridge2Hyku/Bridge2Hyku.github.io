The Bridge2Hyku (B2H) project aims to establish a framework for sustainable digital collections data migration to [Hyku](https://github.com/samvera-labs/hyku), the digital asset management software developed by the [Hydra-In-A-Box](http://hydrainabox.samvera.org/) project. The B2H project leverages the [Institute for Museum and Library Service’s (IMLS)](https://www.imls.gov/) investment ([LG-70-17-0217-17](https://www.imls.gov/grants/awarded/lg-70-17-0217-17)) in building capacity for libraries and cultural heritage institutions to adopt Hyku. B2H will engage and strengthen the open source [Samvera Community](http://samvera.org/) (formerly Hydra Project) around Hyku by leveraging our collective expertise through strategic collaboration between the [B2H project partners](partners.md).

This project will deliver national impact by addressing the following IMLS performance goals:
- Broaden access and expand use of the Nation’s content and collections, by helping libraries and cultural heritage institutions migrate their digital collections to the Hydra-in-a-Box platform and promote them to DPLA.
- Improve management of the Nation’s content and collections, by assisting institutions in migrating to a community supported, nationally recognized digital platform, which promises better management and shared expertise of institutions’ digital assets.

This two year project (October 2017 - September 2019) is divided into three phases:
1. Phase One (October 2017 - March 2018): the team will identify [general](migration.md) and [system-specific](hyku.md) requirements for migrating digital collections data to Hyku.
2. Phase Two (April 2018 - May 2019): work during this phase will be dedicated to [migration software](toolkit.md) development and documentation, and the creation of content for this [B2H website](https://bridge2hyku.github.io/).
3. Phase Three (June 2019 - September 2019): the team will assess, improve, and promote the B2H project's suite of open source resource, or toolkit.

The B2H team will track and conduct project activities using Agile project management methodology and assess project goals and outcomes at the completion of each phase. The team will also explore possibilities for incorporating its resources within the Samvera Community codebase. To make the B2H toolkit sustainable, the [University of Houston Libraries](https://libraries.uh.edu/) will maintain the stewardship of the [B2H Github Organization](https://github.com/bridge2hyku) during and after the grant period. The project team will also [encourage active participation](contact.md) from digital collections professionals to ensure that the B2H toolkit continues to be an essential resource for data migrations to Hyku over the long term.
