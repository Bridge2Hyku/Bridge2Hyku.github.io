Welcome to the Workshop page of our website.  We've completed workshops at two conferences so far:

[Joint Conference on Digital Libraries](https://2019.jcdl.org/) - Urbana-Champaign, June 2nd-6th


Are you a consortium or group that'd be interested in having our workshop taught? Reach out to us! We'd be happy to present it again.
