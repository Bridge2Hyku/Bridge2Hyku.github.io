Bridge2Hyku is an IMLS-funded grant project to build software and documentation for migrating to Hyku.

The [Bridge2Hyku](https://bridge2hyku.github.io/) (B2H) project aims to establish a framework for sustainable digital collections data migration to [Hyku](https://github.com/samvera-labs/hyku), the digital asset management software developed by the [Hydra-In-A-Box](http://hydrainabox.samvera.org/) project. The B2H project leverages the Institute for Museum and Library Serviceâ€™s investment ([LG-70-17-0217-17](https://www.imls.gov/grants/awarded/lg-70-17-0217-17)) in building capacity for libraries and cultural heritage institutions to adopt Hyku. B2H will engage and strengthen the open source [Samvera Community](http://samvera.org/) (formerly Hydra Project) around Hyku by leveraging our collective expertise through strategic collaboration between the [B2H project partners](https://bridge2hyku.github.io/partners/).
